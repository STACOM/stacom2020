| 14:00 – 15:00 UTC | **The right ventricle – The no longer forgotten chamber**<br>Keynote speaker: Associate Professor Pamela Moceri, MD, PhD<br><br>Although it has been under studied as compared to the left ventricle, the recognition of the central role of the right ventricle is growing in a large number of pathologies. The right ventricle is anatomically and functionally different than the left ventricle. This prevents us from extrapolating our knowledge of left-ventricular physiology and pathophysiology to the right ventricle. Distinct right ventricular patterns are observed in pressure overload, volume overload and RV cardiomyopathy. Imaging, new right ventricular function quantification tools and modeling RV response to different loading conditions may help us better understand the mechanisms of right ventricular failure and thus prevent it.<br><br>Pamela Moceri is Associate Professor (MD, PhD) in Cardiology In Nice (France, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice). She is responsible of the local competence center for the management of pulmonary hypertension and complex congenital heart diseases. Her clinical and research activity focus mainly on imaging the right ventricle: echocardiography, diagnosis and patient care in pulmonary hypertension or congenital heart disease. She combines clinical data to statistical modeling of right ventricular shape and function.
