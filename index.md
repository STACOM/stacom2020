The Statistical Atlases and Computational Modeling of the Heart (STACOM) workshop has been running annually at MICCAI since 2010. The 11th edition of STACOM workshop will be held in conjunction with the [MICCAI 2020](https://www.miccai2020.org/en/) on 4 October 2020 in Lima, Peru. The STACOM workshop is aiming to create a collaborative forum for young/senior researchers (engineers, biophysicists, mathematicians) and clinicians, working on: statistical analysis of cardiac morphology and dynamics, computational modelling of the heart and fluid dynamics, data/models sharing, personalisation of cardiac electro-mechanical models, quantitative image analysis and translational methods into clinical practice.

## Video presentations

Video presentations of some regular session papers are available from [STACOM2020 YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTkKViFOZ_FcbL65nbgzdg/videos).

## Challenges

### Myocardial pathology segmentation combining multi-sequence CMR

The target of this challenge is combining multi-sequence CMR data to classify the myocardial pathology. Specifically, the myocardium will be classified into normal, infarcted and oedema regions, which is important for the diagnosis and treatment management of patients post myocardial infarction.

### Multi-Centre, Multi-Vendor, Multi-Disease Cardiac Image Segmentation Challenge

This challenge aims to contribute to the effort of building generalisable models that can be applied in day to day clinical practice, as well as to provide an open dataset for future research and advancements in generalisable models.

### Automatic Evaluation of Myocardial Infarction from Delayed-Enhancement Cardiac MRI

The two main objectives of the EMIDEC challenge are first to classify normal and pathological cases from the clinical information with or without delayed enhancement MRI (DE-MRI), and secondly to automatically detect the different relevant areas (the myocardial contours, the infarcted area and the permanent microvascular obstruction area (no-reflow area)) from a series of short-axis DE-MRI covering the left ventricle. The segmentation allows us to make a quantification of the myocardial infarction, in absolute value (mm3) or percentage of the myocardium.
